How to build
============

**It should be built** from the ``mosaic-distribution`` repository, as it depends on a proper set workbench and symlinks to other
repositories...

* dependencies:

 * ``erlang`` version ``R15Bx`` (where ``x`` is ``01``, ...);
 * ``gcc``, ``binutils``, ``make``, and other libraries and standard development tools (required by Riak native code);
 * ``vbs`` and ``ninja`` latest version;
 * correct setup of symlinks towards other source code repositories;

* inside a console, into the root folder of the project: ::

  ./scripts/prepare
  ./scripts/compile

How to run
==========

* inside a console, into the root folder of the project: ::

  ./scripts/run-component


How to use
==========

Just like a normal Riak, but listening on:

* http://127.0.0.1:24637/ endpoint for the HTTP-based interface;
* ``tcp:127.0.0.1:22652`` endpoint for the ProtocolBuffers-based interface;

See http://basho.com/products/riak-overview for details.
